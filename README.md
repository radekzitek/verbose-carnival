General

Consistent Styling: Ensure a consistent styling approach throughout the application (e.g., using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or PostCSS, or a CSS-in-JS solution).
Code Formatting: Use a code formatter (like Prettier) to automatically format your code for consistency.
Component Structure: Consider a more granular component structure, breaking down larger components into smaller, reusable ones.
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling, especially in API calls. Display user-friendly error messages.
Accessibility: Pay attention to accessibility (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML) to make your application usable by everyone.
Specific Files

AppLayout.vue:
Consider using named slots for the header, sidebar, main content, and footer to make the layout more flexible.
If the sidebar and header are static, consider hardcoding them directly into the template instead of using separate components.
AppHeader.vue:

Consider extracting the menu items into a separate configuration file or store for better maintainability.
AppSidebar.vue:

Consider extracting the sidebar items into a separate configuration file or store for better maintainability.
Use more descriptive alt text for images.
LoginView.vue and RegisterView.vue:
Extract the form into a reusable component.
Use a validation library (like VeeValidate or Yup) to handle form validation.
Consider using a more secure method for storing passwords (e.g., hashing on the client-side before sending to the server).
authStore.js:
Consider using a more secure method for storing authentication tokens (e.g., using HTTP-only cookies or a dedicated authentication library).
main.js:
Remove the commented-out code.
